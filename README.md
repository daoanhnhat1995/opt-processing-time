# OPT processing timeline analysis
- OPT applications for F1 international students can take anywhere from 2 months to 3 months while USCIS only updates case status 2 months after application has been received. <br />
- This program fetches statuses of applications that were received from a month earlier than yours. <br />
Based on previous records, you might have a better idea about the processing timeline for your application. <br />
