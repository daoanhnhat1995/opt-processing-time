# OPT processing timeline analysis
- OPT applications for F1 international students can take anywhere from 2 months to 3 months while USCIS only updates case status 2 months after application has been received. <br />
- This program fetches cases statuses from applications that are received from a month earlier than you. <br />
Based on those statuses, you might have a better idea of the processing timeline for your application. <br />
